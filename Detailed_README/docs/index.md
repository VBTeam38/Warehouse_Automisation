## <b>Summary</b>

In this project, we have simulated the Amazon Warehouse environment. The tools we have used are ROS, Gazebo, and RVIZ. The simulation consists of two robotic arms, namely UR5_1 and UR5_2, a shelf consisting of all the packages with different priorities, a conveyor belt, and bins to sort the packages based on how they must be shipped.

When an order is placed, the UR5_1 arm picks up the required package from the shelf and places it on the conveyor belt. The conveyor belt takes it to the UR5_2 arm, which sorts the packages to be shipped. Packages with higher priority are picked first.

The orders are received using IOT technologies. As the orders are dispatched and shipped in the warehouse, respective emails are sent to the customers informing them of the same. There is also a dashboard which displays the status of packages in real time.
